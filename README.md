# Advanced Data Analysis for Management Support
As part of the “Advanced Data Analysis for Management Support” lecture I worked on three different machine learning tasks. In the first one I used data that captures user activity on an online retail website to predict the conversion of clients during a session.
The second task entailed using a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to predict book ratings given a data set of book reviews.
Finally, I used a data set of Medium articles to predict the respective number of claps each article got. I used a multi-input model consisting of two branches to combine textual and non-textual data.
